Project summary: 
In June, the company achieved a significant 13% month-on-month growth, marked by increased profits and reduced losses. This positive trend followed a period of remarkable growth in March but was later marred by a dip in revenue and profit, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistency.
Regional performance analysis reveals:
Missouri's ascent as a rising star, surpassing Wisconsin in sellout contributions, signifying its growing significance.
Wisconsin's consistent leadership, contributing a substantial 22% of total sales.
Oklahoma's impressive sales performance, with a solid 16% contribution, indicating room for further growth.
Ohio's challenge in performance, ranking the lowest among states and contributing only 5% of total sales, prompting the need for targeted strategies for improvement.
Segment-wise categorization showcases key areas:
"Cash Cows" in the above 50 and 40 to 50 segments, contributing around 60% of both profit and revenue, warranting increased focus and expansion.
The 20 to 30 segment, recognized as the most sellable in terms of both revenue and quantity, albeit cautioning against spreading focus too thin.
The 30-40 segment, deemed an "Underperformer," contributing only 10% of revenue and 7% of quantity, necessitating reduction in items to focus on higher-performing segments.
"Question Marks" encompassing the 10-20 and below 10 quantity segments, contributing around 35-40% of quantity but only 10% of revenue, hinting at the need for reduction or optimization due to inefficiency.
